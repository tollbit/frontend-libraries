        STORIES TAGGED:\nApple\n\nFounded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak,
        and Ronald Wayne, Apple is best known for making some of the world's
        most ubiquitous consumer devices, software, and services: the iPhone,
        iPad, iMac and MacBook computers, Apple TV, Apple Watch, iOS, iCloud,
        iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and many more. Led by CEO Tim Cook since
        2011, Apple is one of the largest technology companies in the world
        alongside Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\n\nFeatured

        marketing.\n\nBefore you buy something like Anker’s new MagGo SD card
        reader to take advantage of that high-fps video capture on the iPhone 16
        Pro, go read PetaPixel’s warning about product marketing and the limits
        of SD cards.\n\nPetaPixel today confirmed that the iPhone
        can technically shoot 4K at 30 frames per second (FPS) in ProRes Log to
        a UHS-II SD card, but attempting to choose a higher frame rate would
        guarantee dropped frames.\n\n\n\nBefore You Use an SD Card as an

        briefly being disabled, writes X user Aaron Perris.\n\nIt seems to work
        for me, so if, like 9to5Mac’s Abner Li, you had trouble with the feature

        iPads, Apple won’t include Apple logo stickers in the boxes of the
        iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, 9to5Mac reports. You can apparently ask for
        a sticker when purchasing an iPhone 16 at an Apple Store,

        would now present too significant a risk to Apple’s threat-intelligence
        program,” Apple says in a filing. Apple sued NSO Group in 2021.\n\nOne
        cited development: The Guardian’s reporting that Israeli officials took
        documents about NSO Group’s Pegasus software that are relevant to a
